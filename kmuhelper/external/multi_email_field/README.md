# Important

The code in this folder has not been created by me. It is a copy from [django-multi-email-field](https://github.com/fle/django-multi-email-field).

## Reason

Reason for this copy is that `ugettext_lazy` has been deprecated for quite a while now but the [pull request](https://github.com/fle/django-multi-email-field/pull/20) replacing it with `gettext_lazy` hasn't been merged yet. It also even seems like the original author hasn't been on GitHub for years.
